This project analyzes two literary works by Grig: "The Basement" and "A Man’s City". These stories portray the lifestyle of Armenian people from Grig’s childhood through his youth. In both narratives, we encounter a wide range of characters, many of whom are prominent members of the intellectual class — individuals who, unfortunately, have often been disregarded and undervalued by society.

As part of our research, we compiled statistics on how each character is described in the stories and categorized them based on positive and negative traits. The analysis confirmed our initial hypothesis: life during that time was indeed difficult, and intellectuals were significantly underappreciated. This is reflected in the prevalence of negative descriptions for most characters, such as “miserable old man,” “worn-out clothing,” “suffocating stench,” and so on.

However, there was one notable exception — Sofa — a character who is primarily portrayed through positive traits like being “lively,” “neatly dressed,” and “constantly on the move.” Still, we propose that her excessive talkativeness may have a deeper psychological explanation.

We hypothesize that Sofa exhibits characteristics of Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD). Individuals with HPD typically have a strong need to be seen and admired, and they may display exaggerated or theatrical behavior to capture attention. They often use their physical appearance — such as clothing, makeup, or body language — to attract notice. Additionally, those with HPD may struggle to form lasting, meaningful relationships due to shallow emotional expression and a tendency to overestimate the closeness of interpersonal connections.

These individuals are usually highly dependent on emotional affirmation from others and may feel rejected or abandoned when that attention is lacking. Emotional instability and rapid mood swings are common, and they may respond disproportionately to minor events or perceived slights. Excessive talking is another typical symptom — not necessarily rich in content, but driven by the desire for validation and emotional relief.

Sofa’s appearance and behavior closely match these characteristics, which leads us to suspect that her personality may have been shaped by environmental rather than genetic factors. Her childhood and youth coincided with one of Armenia’s most difficult periods — a time of crisis not only for young people but also for children. The emotional and social pressures of that era could have contributed to the development of HPD as a coping mechanism.

In conclusion, although Sofa may appear to be a joyful and energetic exception in a sea of troubled characters, her behavior too reflects the psychological imprints of her time. Through this analysis, we aimed to explore how historical, environmental, and psychological factors intersect in Grig’s portrayal of post-crisis Armenian life.
